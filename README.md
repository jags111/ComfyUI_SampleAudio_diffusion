# ComfyUI_SampleAudio_diffusion
# Sample Diffusion ComfyUI extension (modified)


## Features
Allows the use of trained [dance diffusion/sample generator](https://github.com/Harmonai-org/sample-generator) models in ComfyUI.<br>
Also included are two optional extensions of the extension (lol); Wave Generator for creating primitive waves aswell as a wrapper for the Pedalboard library.<br>
The pedalboard wrapper allows us to wrap most vst3s and control them, for now only a wrapper for OTT is included. Any suggestions are welcome.<br>
Includes a couple helper functions.

## Installation
1. Install [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)
2. Clone/download as zip and place ```SampleDiffusion``` folder in ```ComfyUI/custom_nodes```.
3. Move/copy playAudio.js from ```SampleDiffusion``` to ```ComfyUI/web/extensions```
4. Place models in ```ComfyUI/models/audio_diffusion``` ('model_folder' entry in config.yaml is accepted).<br>
4.5 (Optional) Install [xfer OTT VST3](https://xferrecords.com/freeware)
5. Launch!
